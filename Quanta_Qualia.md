# Julia Quanta Qualia (DRAFT version)

I am writing this Julia language project as a personal challenge, I realize it will probably take me decades to complete.



## What does Quanta Qualia means, anyway?

Well, you will have to wait for the answer, I am writing a longer paper on that.
The basic idea is that it is a study between computing or "Quanta" and a subjective perception of things or "Qualia". 
The goal of the project is to have the AI to start perceiving the Qualia from the particular person's perspective.




## Could I ever talk to the smartest people I always wanted to meet?

Imagine being able to daily chat with any of these people:
- Leonardo da Vinci
- Issac Newton
- Albert Einstein
- Galileo Galili
- Plato
- Aristotle
- Buddha
- Charles Darwin
- pick a name of your favorite person

I believe that it will become very possible. Even today, supposedly smart people at Google are getting to think that their AI creation, LaMDA, is conscious. I truly believe you will be able to talk to your heroes from the past.



## Why surrounding yourself with the smart people is important?



There is a saying that you are an average of the five people you hang out with. 

Well, I read and listen to a lot of "smart" books, but that is listening, not talking to the authors. At work we only talk about the "delivery" of the product. If you contact someone you value over the Internet, they are either too busy, or think you are selling something.
If I am missing the right peers to talk to today, I can imagine that in 20, 30 or more years it will be even worse.




## What is the goal of Quanta Qualia?



The goal is to have a mentor chatbot that is highly personalized. This is a vastly opposed to generic answers given by Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa. Whereas the later, go for having every answer in the world, it will be OK if my mentor does not have the right answer. 



## What is the example of a chat you would like to have?



With tongue-in-cheek ...

- Hey Charles, what architecture is the Apple M2 chip based on?

- Go ask Siri, I have no idea about ARM chip architecture.

- Sorry, Charles, why didn't you publish the the Origin of Species right after you came back from Galapagos?

- Listen, it took me two decades to collect the thoughts and overcome the fears and even then the public response was a nightmare.

  


## What will be the component technologies of Quanta Qualia project?


The project will try to accomplish the following:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) chat with questions and answers
- train on general corpus of text to achieve "basic" knowledge
- train on my own text, including my blogs and writings to highly personalize it
- organize the gathered knowledge using the graph theory where decisions and relationships between the objects are not mere data points, but neural network models
- implement the principle of many (I mean a lot!) neural networks that take only moments to train and re-deploy
- if successful, I will train clones/avatars on the works of other people
  

## Which people are good candidates to be represented by this bot?



I think people who published a lot of their own thoughts, or there is a large amount of materials written about them.



## Why you train on your own writings?



I train on my own writings because I can judge the success whether the bot gives the answers that I would give. Once when I feel I have achieved some level of success, I can start training on the works of famous authors, scientists and philosophers.



## Why are you writing everything as questions and answers lately?



To train the bot I have to practice.
